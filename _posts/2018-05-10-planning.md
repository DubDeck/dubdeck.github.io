Hi there! Here are some suggestions for readings related to crowdsourcing behavior change, specifically planning.

PlanSourcing: Generating Behavior Change Plans with Friends and Crowds 
E Agapie, L Colusso, S Munson, G Hsieh  

for a more in depth reading following up on this work, read
Crowdsourcing Exercise Plans Aligned with Expert Guidelines and Everyday Constraints
E Agapie, B Chinh, L Pina, D Oviedo, M Welsh, G Hsieh, S Munson 
 
Implementation intentions: Strong effects of simple plans.
Gollwitzer, Peter M.  American psychologist 54.7 (1999): 493.  

for understanding background on action planning. behavior change literature often refers to in relation to action plans, also called "if-then plans" (a "short" version or the longer paper) 
it's good to know of this work, not sure that it will apply directly
Haoqi Zhang, Edith Law, Rob Miller, Krzysztof Gajos, David Parkes, and Eric Horvitz, Human computation tasks with global constraints, .CHI '12

A different perspective on creating plans, in this case crowdsourced, for trip planning, not for behavior change. Useful from a more system oriented perspective.
