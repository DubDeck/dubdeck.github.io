<h3>DOs</h3>
Include a way for a user to watch one or more peer-like individuals successfully perform the target behavior

<h3>DON’Ts</h3>
Assume users know how to engage in a behavior or feel confident in their ability to engage in the behavior solely from written messages and content

    This screenshot allows the user to see a video of someone else doing the target behavior correctly, which can help increase the user’s self-efficacy for engaging in the behavior his/her self. Credit:
