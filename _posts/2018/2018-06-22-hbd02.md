Reminders to remain engaged with a digital health intervention can be good cues to action. However, these reminders may be more effective if they are only sent to people who disengage (versus a weekly reminder that goes out to everyone to stay engaged) and if they address other barriers such as perceived barriers, perceived benefits, and/or self-efficacy.

People get too many reminders, often for things that aren’t relevant or important to them, leading them to ignore important reminders.

“Cancer screening studies have used reminder letters or post- cards as an intervention and found that, for many participants, this intervention is significant... Researchers have found that simple reminders may be all that is needed for women who have already had a mammogram or are contemplating getting another (Saywell and others, 2003).”

NOTE: If messages are being pushed out to users, users should always have ways of turning them off or to opt out of receiving them.
