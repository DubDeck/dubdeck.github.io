DOs
<input type="checkbox">Use incentives that appeal to different values or contexts
<input type="checkbox">Offer a diverse set of incentives for the user to choose from
<input type="checkbox">Identify if the kind of output required for the task or activity is creativity. If yes, offer incentives related to that.
<input type="checkbox">Set a minimum reward size that will attract enough participants.

DONâ€™Ts
<input type="checkbox">Offer too large rewards. It will attract participants interested in the reward rather than the activity.
<input type="checkbox">Be overly complicated with the reward structure.
<input type="checkbox">Do not offer incentives that can insult the user (such as a gym membership after a diet study)
