People are driven by different preferences and values. Let the user choose the right incentive for themselves.

The best incentive often is not the one with the highest monetary value. For example, a $10 Starbucks giftcard easily translates to a coffee and a snack. Sometimes, it may not even involve money, such as a digital badge or bragging rights. Offering choice allows the user to select what is most valuable for themselves.

A study on the impact of incentives on participation bias proved that, people were motivated more by some incentives than others, depending on their personality.

This includes:
Participants who were categorized as “open to change” performed best with no pay or a lottery entry than fixed pay or a charity donation
Participants who were categorized with “self-transcendence values” performed best with fixed pay
