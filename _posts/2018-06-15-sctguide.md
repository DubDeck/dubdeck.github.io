# DOs
<input type="checkbox">Create exercises that advances the user through a progression of steps

<input type="checkbox">Provide positive or constructive feedback responses to the user as they progress

<input type="checkbox">Communicate the time horizon of the expected outcome (short or long term)

<input type="checkbox">Communicate whether the consequences are negative or positive

<input type="checkbox">Communicate the type of consequence (e.g., negative financial impact)

<input type="checkbox">Use people for vicarious experience models that are similar and relatable

<input type="checkbox">Provide experience models that show barriers being surmounted


# DON’Ts
<input type="checkbox">Avoid using a training format that the user is unfamiliar with

<input type="checkbox">Don’t train about substance interventions without also encouraging a decrease in substance abuse

<input type="checkbox">Do not exaggerate the potential negative outcome

<input type="checkbox">Do not obscure the element of self efficacy in reaching positive results or avoiding negative outcomes

<input type="checkbox">Use dissimilar models

<input type="checkbox">Use experience models showing no barriers; later encounters with barriers not previously shown may undermine self-efficacy
