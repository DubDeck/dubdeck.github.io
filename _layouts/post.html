          That is the essence of syntax: the discipline
          that controls the proper use of grammar in the construction of phrases and the articulation of a language, Design. The syntax of design is provided by many components in the nature of the project.

          <span class="fw6">For us Graphic Design is “organization of information.”</span> There are other
          types of graphic design more concerned with illustration or of a
          narrative nature.  Nothing could be more useful to reach our intention
          than the Grid. The grid represents the basic structure of our graphic
          design, it helps to organize the content, it provides consistency, it
          gives an orderly look and it projects a level of intellectual elegance
          that we like to express.  There are in nite kinds of grids, but just
          one - the most appropriate - for any problem. Therefore, it becomes
          important to know which kind of grid is the most appropriate. The basic
          understanding is that the smaller the module of the grid the least
          helpful it could be. We could say that an empty page is a page with an
          in nitesimal small grid. Therefore, it is equivalent to not being
          there. Conversely a page with a coarse grid is a very restricting grid
          offering too few alternatives. The secret is to  nd the proper kind of
          grid for the job at hand. Sometimes, in designing a grid we want to
          have the outside margins small enough to provide a certain tension
          between the edges of the page and the content. After that we divide the
          page in a certain number of columns according to the content, three,
          two, four,  ve, six, etc. Columns provide only one kind of consistency,
          but we also need to have an horizontal frame of reference to assure
          certain levels of continuity throughout the publication. Therefore, we
          will divide the page from top to bottom in a certain number of Modules,
          four, six, eight, or more, according to size and need. Once we have
          structured the page, we will begin to structure the information and
          place it in the grid in such a way that the clarity of the message will
          be enhanced by the placement of the text on the grid. There are in nite
          ways of doing this and that is why the grid is a useful tool, rather
          than a constricting device.

        Theodore Sturgeon was a science fiction author, critic, and the basis for Kurt Vonnegut's recurring character Kilgore Trout. He was prolific, authoring over 200 pieces himself and critiquing around 400 others.
      </p>
      <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
        In 1958 he published a piece in Venture proclaiming what he called "Sturgeon's Revelation"
      </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure i pl4 bl bw1 b--gold mb4">
      I repeat Sturgeon's Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud. Using the same standards that categorize 90% of science fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods, etc. is crap. In other words, the claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other artforms.

    You don't have to bounce a tennis ball very far in San Francisco before it will hit two developers complaining about how many js tools/frameworks there are for development in 2015 and how much unneccessary complexity they add. Doing a search on twitter for 'too many js tools' or 'yet another js framework' returns... a lot of people lamenting the current state of affairs.

    This is most likely, the wrong conversation for us as a community, to be having. The presence of bad tools - shouldn't discourage us from wanting more tools or frameworks. There are more books published in a single day than I will ever be able to read in my lifetime. But this does not make me sad. Or overwhelm me. Mostly I think about how excited I am to read the best books that are being published. And this is where we should push the conversation. How do we build better tools? What does that look like?
